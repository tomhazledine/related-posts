As a developer who came of age at the dawn of Web 2.0, supporting semantic markup is something that I've always been in favour of. I've written in the past about how [HTML doesn't need (much) styling](https://www.tomhazledine.com/html-doesnt-need-any-styling/) to be perfectly functional. So I'm really enjoying the fact that today (April 9th) is "officially" _[CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/)_.

If you're reading this on the 9th, then my whole site will be untouched by CSS. If you're reading on any other day, then it's only _this_ page that's unstyled.

Apart from being a fun exercise, there is a serious point to be made here. A lot of people experience the web via nothing more than the markup (be that through assistive tech like screen readers, or just automated delivery mechanisms like web-scrappers and RSS feeds). The way we structure our documents _matters_.
